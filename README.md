# tetronimo-tug-of-war

A while back I had an idea that there should be a 2-player tetris-like game wherein both players are dropping pieces on the opposite side of the same board.

I worked a handful of days on this project before discovering that the very same game concept exists for the Nintendo DS.

Content with that, I stopped developing this and enjoyed playing the old DS game for a while.

However, this still makes for a decent, simple Tetris clone.  Use arrow keys to control pieces. The game doesn't have wall-jumps, and pieces only land if you hard-drop with the up arrow key. Also, the game goes on forever.

Still a ton of fun, though.
